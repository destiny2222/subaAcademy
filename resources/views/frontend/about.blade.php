                            SUBA Capital started in 2014 as a digital business community under the name Start-Up Business Africa (SUBA), to help business owners with business development knowledge and support until our members started to find it difficult to access micro capital. In July 2017, we secured a state regulated licence to operate as a microfinance institution to be able to pull capital together to co-save, co-invest and co-finance projects for shared profit. We are now registered and licensed under the name SUBA Capital Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society (MPCS) Limited trading as “SUBA Capital”. We launched our pilot product in 2019 with 6 subscribers and have been growing our membership since. Today, we serve over 500 subscribers.

This year (2021) is my 3rd year of contributing with SUBA Capital and it has been amazing. In the 1st year (2019) the money i saved with SUBA Capital helped me cushion the effect of other investments that didnt go as planned. I must confess that my journey with SUBA Capital has been with peace of mind

                                    I just want to say thank you to SUBA Capital for keeping their promise. In this era of scamming people under the guise of agro-investment, SUBA Capital has proven to be trustworthy, and solid. I received my returns on investment yesterday afternoon and the process was so quick and without hassle. Keep it up, guys. The sky is our starting point.

                                Good afternoon everyone,
                                I've been a contributor with SUBA Capital since 2019. I just saw the payment alert from SUBA Capital, as I saw the alert I had to just come here (on the SUBA Capital Telegram community) and share with the community out of excitement. From the alert,you can see that the money entered when I needed it the most as my account was already empty .
                                Thank you SUBA Capital. I'm very very grateful.                                    
                            </p>
