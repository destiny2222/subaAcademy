                <h3>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING:</h3>
                <p>
                    Where we discover that the Platform is being used to launder money or for any suspicious transactions, we have an obligation to report your activities to the relevant authorities without recourse to you.
                </p>
                <h3>FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK:</h3>
                <p>
                    Where a Contributor contributes in a currency other than the Nigerian Naira (NGN), foreign exchange gain or loss and fluctuations in currency rates may have an impact on the Returns made on such contribution by the Contributor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All Returns on contribution shall be converted and returned to Nigerian Naira (NGN) based on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) official exchange rate. The Contributor therefore enters into any transactions in currencies other than the Nigerian Naira (NGN) at their sole risk and shall bear all responsibilities for any gains or loss as a result.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unexpected changes in currency exchange market conditions may have an impact on the extent of Retruns the Contributor would be exposed to such as when there is an upward or downward movement in the relevant rates.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Contributor understands and is able to assume the risk of loss associated and agrees to be liable for any resulting deficit this might have on contributions made or Returns earned.
