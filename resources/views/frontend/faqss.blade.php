                          The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) suggests that retail investors should invest 10% of their annual income per year depending on their risk appetite and other financial considerations. For institutional legal entities who usually set aside 2% - 5% for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), an allocation of 1% - 5% committed to our impact driven investments would not be unreasonable as their investment would still create the much needed social impact.

                          The minimum maturity period for our lending plan is 3 months and for our investment plans, it is at least 12  months. However, different subscriptions plans will have different maturity dates and subscribers can also set their own custom maturity dates. Do note that the deposited funds would be locked and unavailable for withdrawal until maturity. Initiating a withdrawal to liquidate your subscription before maturity dates may attract charges.

                          Our borrowers and farmers undergo bad actor checks typical with the lending ecosystem in Nigeria and across Africa. We analyze the financial behaviour of each prospective borrower using their supplied verifiable data and market potential of the small business requesting for micro capital loan. We also consider geopolitical security risk factors. Whenever possible, our due diligence team will visit with the business or farm in person and where those visits have occurred, they will be noted in the approval summary.
                          Our goal is to provide a wide variety of affordable microfinance services with risk-adjusted returns for our subscribers. We receive many loan and project financing requests from business owners and farmers who want to raise microcapital than we approve. Our number one criteria for approval is the track record of the borrower or farmer. 
                          How long have they been in that business?
                          Do they have experience raising or growing the specific crop or have they contracted with an experienced farm manager to do so? 

                          All that said, SUBA Capital makes no claim as to the financial viability of these credits or their ability to achieve expected pro-forma returns. Subscribers should consult with legal and investment professionals, thoroughly read all Terms and Condition for saving, investing or lending with on our platform before financial commitment to a subscription plan.

                          All investments have some element of risk. Previous performance does not guarantee future results. However, expansive market research have shown that; low risk fixed income assets, small business lending, Financing Agricultural Farm Projects and Commodity Trade are generally pretty safe investment bets. 
                          As a service provider, we have gone the extra mile to take insurance cover for the credit we lend, on the commodities we trade, on the crops we produce and our farmers. This helps to preserve the capital invested at the very least.
